# Case Study - Magic Notes by Beam

* The development of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in social work enhances efficiency, but it requires careful regulation to ensure ethical and effective implementation.

## Overview and Origin

* This case study examines an artificial intelligence (AI) assessment tool called Magic Notes, developed by a UK-based company called Beam. The tool aims to modernize outdated case management systems by introducing innovative tools designed to streamline the handling of social work cases, ultimately speeding up the process of aiding those in need [^1]. Beam was founded in 2017 by Alex Stephany and Seb Barker with a goal to harness new technology in addressing longstanding social challenges. Beam is leveraged Seed funding in 2020, followed by Series A funding in 2023 and 2024. The Beam Foundation, a registered charity, has raised $5 million in donations to date through a mix of crowdfunding from individuals, corporate partnerships, and philanthropic grants [^1].

## Business Activities

* The homelessness crisis in the UK has 14.4 million people living in poverty and over 350,000 people without homes. Rising living costs, inequality, housing and job market pressures elevate the problem. England saw a 14% increase in the number of homeless households from 2022 to 2023. The homeless crisis combined with lack of employment have compounded the individual challenges. With this, there’s an increased need for frontline staff to support the disenfranchised. Social workers are key in getting the people help quickly and the tool Magic Notes aims to modernize outdated case management systems by introducing innovative tools designed to streamline the handling of social work cases, ultimately speeding up the process of aiding those in need [^1]. Beams customers are the homeless and the systemic lower class. There are approximately 33,100 social workers serving 113,000 households that are classified as living in temporary accommodation [^2].

* The Beam tool Magic Notes is based off a holistic support model that provides tangible and long-lasting solutions for people in crisis. The tool leverages AI to record case worker assessments with clients resulting in a dynamic action plan [^1]. Beam's Magic Notes has direct competition from [Social Work Magic](https://www.socialworkmagic.com/).

* Beam utilizes JavaScript frameworks for both front-end and back-end web development. As for Beam's Magic Notes, an AI-powered assessment tool, developed through collaboration between developers and social work professionals, leveraging data and models to enhance case management [^3].

## Landscape

* Beam has been a player in the social work field since 2017. In that time, the need for social work services has grown exponentially. In 2023, the UK announced a social care funding increase of $2.8 billion, followed by $4.7 billion in 2024. The plan also includes enhanced inspection guidelines, digitized care improvements, energy tariff reforms, food waste recycling initiatives, and greater transparency on future objectives [^4].

* Major social work companies in the UK include NHS England, Kent County Council, Sanctuary Personnel & Hertfordshire County Council [^5]. With the increased need, these companies must leverage technology to stay relevant.

* As for AI domain trends, .ai as a TLD has become very popular.

> Consequently, .ai has emerged as one of the most coveted TLDs in the digital landscape. InterNetX has witnessed the rapid rise of .ai as the TLD that charted the highest yearly growth at an unprecedented **256%** [^6].

* AI has become more prevalent in social work. AI is being used for risk assessments, to assist people in crisis, strengthen prevention, identify systemic biases and for the delivery of digitized social services. [^7] As AI continues to evolve at an unprecedented pace, it's becoming increasingly critical to ensure proper oversight and ethical guidelines are in place. As one source noted..

> ..the rise of AI in social work has also sparked concerns about data privacy for families, bias, and whether AI-generated actions will be adequately reviewed before being carried out [^8].

## Results

* In a short time, Beam has made a large business impact on the community by supporting almost 5k people and saving the taxpayer $90 million euros [^9]. Beam uses social metrics to measure the positive social impact. The metrics focus on positive milestones [^10]. Beam is performing moderately considering they haven’t been around a long time in the UK but are well positioned to thrive in the coming years. The dynamic numbers can be found [here](https://beam.org/company-impact). Beam performs well against its competitors, standing out with unique features like crowdfunding for the homeless. Additionally, Beam's employee growth surpasses that of its rivals [^11].

## Recommendations

* In assessing their impact in the social work field, I would recommend developing a tool specifically focused on supporting mental health care. This product will foster a close connection with clients, providing a reliable support system for those who may not have immediate access to a case worker. I’d leverage advanced AI techniques, such as neural networks and machine learning, to transform and enhance mental health support.

* Do mental health applications work? Recent studies show that mobile mental health applications do not replace therapy, but they do complement it [^12].

* The human element, driven by AI models, neural networks, and data, will be key to this tool's success.
